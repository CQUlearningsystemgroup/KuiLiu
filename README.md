# Compressive Convolutional Network (CCN)
### Intruduction
The proposed algorithm of the Compressive Convolutional Network (CCN) features the ability to perform near-isometric compressive sensing using convolutional operations.
A novel incoherent convolution approach is invented for learning the embedded matrix to achieve near-isometric property for compressive sensing.

### **Dependencies**
+ Matlab
+ C++

### **Run Compressive Convolutional Network**
`FrontEnd_Detection&Compression` is the training code, which is modified from the official public YOLOv2 code.
`Demo.m` is a demo to reconstruct the compressive images. You can ran `Demo.m` to gain the reconstruction image with index of PSNR and SSIM.
